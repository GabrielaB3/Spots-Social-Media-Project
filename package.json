  "description": "This project is my first responsive web application, built with the aim of improving my skills in creating adaptable and user-friendly websites. I used various technologies to make the website responsive, including Media Queries to ensure it works across different screen sizes. To maintain clarity and organization in the code, I implemented the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, which helps in managing naming conventions and creating a scalable structure.",
