# Project 3: Spots

## Description of the project and functionality

This project is my first responsive web application, built with the aim of improving my skills in creating adaptable and user-friendly websites. I used various technologies to make the website responsive, including Media Queries to ensure it works across different screen sizes. To maintain clarity and organization in the code, I implemented the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, which helps in managing naming conventions and creating a scalable structure.

One of the key features of the project is the hover functionality integrated into the buttons, which enhances interactivity. The goal of this project was to create a dynamic, interactive experience that is both visually appealing and functional, addressing the need for responsive design and intuitive user interaction.
